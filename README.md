# Investigating-the-Correlation-Between-Sustainability-and-Profitability
ESG &amp; Profitability relation analysis
The primary goal was to explore the relationship between companies' sustainability efforts, quantified through Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria, and their financial performance. 
Utilizing data from over 700 companies, sourced from S&P for ESG scores and Yahoo Finance for financial metrics, the team employed advanced machine learning models, including Random Forest, to analyze and predict the financial outcomes based on companiesâ€™ ESG performance. The analysis tools were built using Python and JMP software, accommodating complex, multi-source data integration and handling various data-related challenges such as missing values and normalization.
The findings suggest that while ESG factors are increasingly important, their impact on profitability can vary greatly by industry for example the Energy sector excel in terms of high profits and high ESG scores.
The project recommends expanding the analytic models to encompass longer-term data and broader industry representation to better understand the dynamics between sustainability practices and profitability. Furthermore, developing tools for real-time tracking of ESG performance could empower more informed strategic decisions in business and investment, aligning financial objectives with sustainability goals.
